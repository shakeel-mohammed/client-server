# Introduction - 1/2 page - saturday (5:50 - 6:30)
What is this project? This report presented is to describe the overview, design, and
implementation of an optimised scheduling system compared to it's stage 1 counterpart (found here). The goal of the optimisation is the reduce the average turn around time of job scheduled when compared to the 4 baseline scheduling algorithms being First-Capable, First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit. The results generated by the first script found in this project will highlight the benefits and drawback of the optimised algorithm when compared to each of the 4 baseline algorithms.

At itâ€™s core, a distributed system is a system that has various components which
are spread across a network. This provides many advantages such as efficiency and
redundancy, it also introduces complications such as an increased complexity, synchro-
nisation and replication issues.

In a distributed system, the load is distributed across multiple machines to achieve
fast and more reliable results. Each distributed system requires a component to or-
chestrate and distribute each request.

This project acts as an orchestrating component of a distributed system.

The goal for this project is to have a client which connects to the server, and makes sceduling decisions that result in an optimised turn around time in the processing of each job when compared to the 4 baseline algorithms.

# Problem definition - 1/2 page - saturday (7:00 - 7:30)
- give description of the scheduling problem
- define my objective function and include justification of my choice

# Algorithm description - 1 page - saturday (8:00 - 8:30)
- provide a simple example scheduling scenario including a sample configuration, the schedule, the description and discussion; this is to visualise how the scheduling algorithm works

# Implementation details including data structures - 1/2 page - saturday (9:00 - 9:30)

# Evaluation - 2 pages - sunday
- simulation setup including test cases/configurations, results, comparisons (with
FF, BF, WF and FC) and discussion including pros and cons of the algorithm. Use figures and tables
effectively and be space conscious.

# Conclusion - 1/4 page - sunday
- summary + what I have found and what I suggest.

# References - 1/4 page - sunday
- including project git repository link, e.g., GitHub
